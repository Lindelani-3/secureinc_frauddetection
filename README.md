# Fraudulent Transaction Identification System

### Meta

**Company**: Secure Transactions Inc.

**Data Specs**:
- Transaction data including transaction amount, time, and customer behavior indicators.
- Labels indicating fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

### Workplace Requirements:

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions with a focus on minimizing false negatives (missing fraudulent transactions) while controlling the rate of false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraudulent).

**Tasks:**
- Preprocess and analyze transaction data to identify relevant features for fraud detection.
- Compare multiple machine learning models on key performance metrics, including PR AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, with a focus on PR AUC and Recall.
- Optimize the chosen model to improve its ability to detect fraudulent transactions.

**Deliverables:**
- A machine learning model optimized for fraud detection.
- A report detailing the model's performance, including PR AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, along with a justification for the chosen model.
- An implementation plan for integrating the model into the client's transaction processing system.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A deployed model that significantly improves the client's ability to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, thereby reducing financial losses due to fraud and enhancing customer trust.
